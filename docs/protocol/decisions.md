# Protocol decision ledger

This ledger is append-only. It records decisions that affect how acceptance
evidence is interpreted.

## 2026-09-01 — Naming-gate history boundary

- Decision: the no-comparator name gate scans the whole current working tree
  and every reachable commit message whose committer timestamp is later than
  baseline commit `864736979c92a08ba77e8580d61946eba6864918`.
- Reason: history published before that baseline remains part of the public
  AGPL provenance and the density evidence. Rewriting it would invalidate
  existing commit and tree identities without improving the shipped tree.
- Consequence: pre-baseline history is explicitly out of scope; current files
  are never grandfathered, regardless of when their text first appeared.

## 2026-09-03 — Consolidation onto `main` and the lost readability batch

- Decision: pull requests 11–40 were merged into each other's feature
  branches, not into `main`. The tip of that chain
  (`codex/readability-incident-response-remediation`, 32 commits) is merged
  onto `claude/inherit-service-redesign-3r43mb` and proposed to `main` as one
  pull request (#41). Further v2 work continues on that branch.
- Reason: `main` stopped at pull request 10; every later "merged" pull request
  was invisible to production and to CI on `main`.
- Consequence: the previous session's final readability batch (self-hosting,
  terms, state-privacy rewrites and runtime-copy extraction) was never pushed
  and could not be recovered from the remote. Its copy scope was redone here;
  the runtime-copy extraction remains open and keeps G1.10 at NO.

## 2026-09-03 — Modelled-figure marker string

- Decision: the once-per-claim-block marker for modelled figures is the gate
  string in G4.2, `This is a model, not an observed outcome.` The §4 §3.5
  sentence `This is a modelled estimate, not a measurement.` is not rendered
  in addition, because two sentences saying the same thing on every card is
  the caveat-stacking X0.1 forbids.
- Reason: §8 defines complete resolution and its detector asserts the G4.2
  string once per block; §4 governs what a surface may say but the two strings
  carry the same claim, so choosing the gate-checked one loses no accuracy.
- Consequence: `src/lib/figures/contract.ts` exports the single marker;
  `e2e` and unit tests assert it once per `[data-claim-block]`.

## 2026-09-03 — Natural-frequency denominator rule

- Decision: X4.1 governs. Denominators are 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 and
  1,000,000; one denominator per claim block, the smallest that renders every
  figure in the block as an integer of at least 1 and keeps figures that
  differ by more than display precision distinct; otherwise the block renders
  `Fewer than 1 in a million, both for you and for the comparison group.`
- Reason: G4.1's two-rung rule (100, then 1,000) and §4 §2.3's four-rung
  ladder conflict with each other; X4.1 is the cross-cutting rule and says the
  matching regex must admit 100.
- Consequence: `src/lib/figures/natural-frequency.ts` implements the rule;
  tests pin the worked vectors.
